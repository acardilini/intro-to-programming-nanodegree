## Requires Changes

1 SPECIFICATION REQUIRES CHANGES

You did a great job! Even though you've got a couple of things left to do, they'll all be very quick to do. Just make the changes, re-submit, and you'll pass with flying colors! :smile: many regards

### Game Review

* Game has 3 or more levels and each level contains 4 or more blanks to fill in
* Immediately after running the program, user is prompted to select a difficulty level from easy / medium / hard
* Once a level is selected, game displays a fill-in-the-blank and a prompt to fill in the first blank.
* When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the previous blank and a new prompt for the next blank
* When player guesses incorrectly, they are prompted to try again

### Code Review

* Code uses variables to avoid magic numbers
* Each variable name reflects the purpose of the value stored in it
* Once initiated, the purpose of each variable is maintained throughout the program
* No variables override Python built-in values (for example, def)
* Functions are used as tools to automate tasks which are likely to be repeated
* Functions produce the appropriate output (typically with a return statement) from the appropriate input (function parameters)
* No functions are longer than 18 lines of code (does not include blank lines, comments, or function and variable definitions)
  * Unfortunately, this function is over the limit of 18 lines. One thing you can do is break up this function into two functions. Think about where you can cut a large chunk of code and paste it in another function. __(Make this change)__
* The appropriate data types are used consistently (strings for text, lists for ordered data, nested lists as appropriate)
* Student demonstrates coding techniques like branching and loops appropriately (i.e. to loop through a list, for element in list:; or to test whether something is in a list, if name in list_names:)
* Each function includes a comment which explains the intended behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable)
