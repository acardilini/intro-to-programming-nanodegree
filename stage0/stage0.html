  <h2>Stage0: Getting Started with HTML</h2>
  <h3>Understanding the Web</h3>
  <p>
    In it's simplest form the World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of
    hyperlinked HTML documents. There are several components of the web which
    are required for it to function including, you and your hardware and a
    browser, the internet and severs. The browser sends HTTP requests to servers
    via the internet which then send back files in response, these files are
    interpretted and displayed by your browser.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>
    HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, documentsare are the
    heart of the web and tell browsers what pages should look like. These
    documents are written in a text language that browsers can interpret to
    create webpages, links to other pages, embed media and make it possible to
    create the web as we know it.
  </p>
  <h3>The Markup Language</h3>
  <p>
    The markup language is made up of tags which define the proporties of an
    element. The majority of tags contain an opening and closing tag, with the
    content between these taking on the properties defined by the tag. The
    properties of a tag are determined by it's name, for instance, to create
    text that is <b>bold</b>, it is wrapped by tags which specify that the text
    should be bold: e.g. &lt;<span style="color:blue">b</span>&gt;CONTENTS&lt;<span style="color:blue">/b</span>&gt;. Where the tag name = b and defines that
    the contents should be bold. You will notice that the closing tag has a
    forward slash '/' before the tag name, this is to distinguish between
    opening and closing tags. There are lots of different tags, each of which
    defines a different property some of which include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h1 style="display:inline">Header 1</h1> to <h6 style="display:inline">Header 6</h6>  = &lt;<span style="color:blue">hX</span>&gt;
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Emphasis</em> = &lt;<span style="color:blue">em</span>&gt;
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="display:inline">Paragraph</p> = &lt;<span style="color:blue">p</span>&gt;
      </li>
    </ul>

    There are also a small number of tags which don't have a closing tag because
    they don't contain content. An example of this is the &lt;<span style="color:blue">br</span>&gt; tag which specifies when a line break should
    occur.

    When a mistake occurs in code it can be easy to want to blame the computer
    for not doing what you want, however, keep in mind that computers are
    'stupid' in the sense that they will only ever do what they are told. So if
    a big occurs it will be a mistake that you have accidently written (or not
    written) into the code.
  </p>
  <h3>Attributes</h3>
  <p>
    Tags can also contain attributes, with the value of the attribute defin or additional properties of the content of the tag. This is best highlighted using
    the tag for creating hypelinks because it always requires a specific attribute.
    The tag is &lt;<span style="color:blue">a</span> href="LINK">&gt;CONTENTS&lt;/<span style="color:blue">a</span>&gt;. As you can see this tag includes an attribute,
    <b>href=</b>, in the opening tag. The href attribute specifies the URL of the
    page that the link will go to, with the contents being set up as a link. There
    is a good explaination this tag at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp">W3Schools</a>.

    Another example of a tag which reqires attributes is the &lt;<span>img</span>&gt;
    tag which makes it possible to include images on a webpage. This tag requires
    two standard attributes <b>src=</b>, which indicates the location of the
    image to be used, and <b>alt=</b>, which specifies text to display if the src
    link is broken. The image tag is another example of a tag without a closing tag
    because it doesn't require content.
  </p>
  <h3>Container Tags</h3>
  <p>
    Container tags are simply tags which do nothing but contain the content within
    them, and which can be used to add style to content. Two container tags include,
    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;<span style="color:blue">span</span>&gt;, an inline tag; and
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;<span style="color:blue">div</span>&gt; a block tag.
      </li>
    </ul>
    All tags have a predefined position type, which specifies whether they are
    <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. This determines how the content within the
    tag behaves in relationship to the elements around it, e.g. other tags. Inline
    elements will sit next to one another on the same line, whereas, block elements
    will cause a line break and sit below the preceeding element. Inline elements
    include, <em>emphasis</em> and <b>bold</b>, which as you can see sit side by
    side with other elements. While, paragraph and headingX, are block elements
    which sit on their own lines.<br><br>
    It is also important to note that any whitespace with HTML code is turned into
    a single space. This includes multiple spaces and enters which will all be
    turned into a single whitespace when rendered.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML Document Setup</h3>
  <p>
    To create a HTML document it must contain a few vital elements which include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;<span>!DOCTYPE HTML</span>&gt; - defines what kind of html the document is.
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;<span>HTML</span>&gt; - Surrounds the entrie document
        </li>
      <li>
        &lt;<span>head</span>&gt; - Contains metadata and other scripts like, CSS and Javascrip
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;<span>title</span>&gt; - The title of the page or the URL
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; - Identifies the
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;<span>body</span>&gt; - Everything you actually see on the webpage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    After submitting this page for review I received some great feedback which
    taught me something new. When trying to show HTML code within a HTML document
    special entity syntax must be used, which can be found under <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">HTML entities</a> on
    W3School. An example of these include:
    <xmp>
      &lt;, for 'less than'
      &lt;, for 'greater than'
    </xmp>

    In order to display the text of these HTML entities as an example, as above,
    in an they must be contained within &lt;xmp&gt;CONTENT&lt;/xmp&gt; tags. There
    is some controversy over the use of the &lt;xmp&gt; tag, but a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16783708/how-to-display-raw-html-code-in-pre-or-something-like-it-but-without-escaping-it/16784925#16784925">stack overflow
    thread</a> discusses the problems and solutions for displaying HTML code within
    a HTML document.
