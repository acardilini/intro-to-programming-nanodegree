      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          In it's simplest form the World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of
          hyperlinked HTML documents. There are several components of the web which
          are required for it to function including, you and your hardware and a
          browser, the internet and severs. The browser sends HTTP requests to servers
          via the internet which then send back files in response, these files are
          interpretted and displayed by your browser.

        <h3>HTML</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, documentsare are the
          heart of the web and tell browsers what pages should look like. These
          documents are written in a text language that browsers can interpret to
          create webpages, links to other pages, embed media and make it possible to
          create the web as we know it.

        <h3>The Markup Language</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The markup language is made up of tags which define the proporties of an
          element. The majority of tags contain an opening and closing tag, with the
          content between these taking on the properties defined by the tag. The
          properties of a tag are determined by it's name, for instance, to create
          text that is <b>bold</b>, it is wrapped by tags which specify that the text
          should be bold: e.g. &lt;<span class="tag-name">b</span>&gt;CONTENTS&lt;<span class="tag-name">/b</span>&gt;.
          Where the tag name = b and defines that
          the contents should be bold. You will notice that the closing tag has a
          forward slash '/' before the tag name, this is to distinguish between
          opening and closing tags. There are lots of different tags, each of which
          defines a different property some of which include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h1 style="display:inline">Header 1</h1> to <h6 style="display:inline">Header 6</h6> = &lt;<span class="tag-name">hX</span>&gt;
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Emphasis</em> = &lt;<span class="tag-name">em</span>&gt;
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="display:inline">Paragraph</p> = &lt;<span class="tag-name">p</span>&gt;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are also a small number of tags which don't have a closing tag because
          they don't contain content. An example of this is the &lt;<span class="tag-name">br</span>&gt; tag which specifies when a line break should occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a mistake occurs in code it can be easy to want to blame the computer
          for not doing what you want, however, keep in mind that computers are
          'stupid' in the sense that they will only ever do what they are told. So if
          a big occurs it will be a mistake that you have accidently written (or not
          written) into the code.

        <h3>Attributes</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Tags can also contain attributes, with the value of the attribute defin or additional properties of the content of the tag. This is best highlighted using
          the tag for creating hypelinks because it always requires a specific attribute.
          The tag is &lt;<span class="tag-name">a</span> href="LINK"&gt;CONTENTS&lt;/<span class="tag-name">a</span>&gt;. As you can see this tag includes an attribute,
          <b>href=</b>, in the opening tag. The href attribute specifies the URL of the
          page that the link will go to, with the contents being set up as a link. There
          is a good explaination this tag at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp">W3Schools</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of a tag which reqires attributes is the &lt;<span class="tag-name">img</span>&gt;
          tag which makes it possible to include images on a webpage. This tag requires
          two standard attributes <b>src=</b>, which indicates the location of the
          image to be used, and <b>alt=</b>, which specifies text to display if the src
          link is broken. The image tag is another example of a tag without a closing tag
          because it doesn't require content.

        <h3>Container Tags</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Container tags are simply tags which do nothing but contain the content within
          them, and which can be used to add style to content. Two container tags include,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;<span class="tag-name">span</span>&gt;, an inline tag; and
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;<span class="tag-name">div</span>&gt; a block tag.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All tags have a predefined position type, which specifies whether they are
          <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. This determines how the content within the
          tag behaves in relationship to the elements around it, e.g. other tags. Inline
          elements will sit next to one another on the same line, whereas, block elements
          will cause a line break and sit below the preceeding element. Inline elements
          include, <em>emphasis</em> and <b>bold</b>, which as you can see sit side by
          side with other elements. While, paragraph and headingX, are block elements
          which sit on their own lines.<br><br>
          It is also important to note that any whitespace with HTML code is turned into
          a single space. This includes multiple spaces and enters which will all be
          turned into a single whitespace when rendered.

          After submitting this page for review I received some great feedback which
          taught me something new. When trying to show HTML code within a HTML document
          special entity syntax must be used, an explanation can be found at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">HTML entities</a> on
          W3School. An example of these include:
        </p>

          &lt;, for 'greater than'

        <p>
          In order to display the text of these HTML entities as an example, as above,
          in an they must be contained within &lt;<span class="tag-name">xmp</span>&gt;
          CONTENT&lt;<span class="tag-name">/xmp</span>&gt; tags. There
          is some controversy over the use of the &lt;<span class="tag-name">xmp</span>&gt; tag, but a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16783708/how-to-display-raw-html-code-in-pre-or-something-like-it-but-without-escaping-it/16784925#16784925">stack overflow

      <div class="lesson-description">
        <p>
          This lesson focuses on developing an understanding of how a HTML document is structured and how web
          browsers interpret that structure. It also goes through the purpose of HTML,
          CSS and DOM.

          <b>Why start learning programming with front-end web development?</b><br>Understanding
          front end web dev is one of the few areas of programming that is visual, which
          allows new students to immediately see the effects of their programming. This is
          a good feedback mechanism for beginner programmers who are just starting to learn.
          It's also an easy way to share what you are creating, which allows you to show
          off your skills to others easily and get feedback.

        <p>
          Having a conceptual understanding of how the different components of a webpage
          work will help translate visual designs into webpages. HTML provides the
          structure of a page, whereas CSS defines the style of the house, such as
          the colouring and decoration. Browsers build a branching tree-like structure
          of the page, which represents the association between different elements.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Many web browsers have development tools that allow you to inspect the structure
          and underlying code that defines a webpage. You can use google chromes development tools
          by right clicking anywhere on a webpage and selecting 'inspect'. This shows both
          HTML and CSS style, and can be directly interacted with to see how changes
          effect the webpage.

        <h3>A Webpage Trinity (HTML-CSS-DOM)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are both language of the web with a specific syntax and sets of rules. The basic word in
          the HTML language is 'tag', which browsers turn into elements that form a tree
          (or DOM). The Document Object Model (DOM) is a standard way of representing and
          interacting with HTML tags, and the tree that is seen in a browsers dev tool is
          actually a DOM. Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM which the browser
          use to create the webpage. The HTML document identifies what CSS
          stylesheet that should be used to style the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a good understand of both HTML and CSS languages it is possible to
          look at a page and see how it can be broken down into it's different
          elements, or how a page might be built.

        <h3>The Web is Full of Boxes!</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Every element on a webpage is a box, even circles are boxes! CSS can be used
          to style elements, such as coloured boxes, and make the look like circles, e.g.
          'border-radius'. However, the element is still fundamentally a box, its just
          that it's style has been changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thinking about the elements of a website in terms of boxes makes it simple to
          organise and rearrange webpages. It allows you to think about a webpage in
          terms of a grid, and identify where each element will be placed within that grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are given a mock design, it can helpful to boxify the design by drawing
          boxes around the different elements you have identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boxes are defined by &lt;<span class="tag-name">div</span>&gt; tags.
          When creating a new webpage, start by
          setting up all of the boxes/div tags you need. To be able to apply style
          to your divs, e.g. size and location, it is helpful to give each element
          a class attribute which distinguishes it's purpose. CSS can then be used
          to style each of the different divs depending on its class. It's important
          to make each class attribute meaningful to the div that it identifies so
          that you recognise what it is at a later date.

        <h3>The Basics of Style</h3>

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There are several ways to add style to a HTML document including directly
          within each tag, between &lt;<span class="tag-name">style</span>&gt;
          tags in the &lt;<span class="tag-name">head</span>&gt; of the
          head of the HTML doc, or by using a CSS stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a CSS reduces the amount of repitive coding that needs to be done
          because it can be linked to many pages at once, and one change could lead
          to changes in many documents. For example, if you style was between
          &lt;<span class="tag-name">style</span>&gt;
          across multiple webpages you would need to change every webpage seperately,
          however with CSS you only have to change it once in a single CSS file that is linked
          to all of the pages!
        </p>
        <p>
          Your HTML document is linked to a CSS document by including a
          &lt;<span class="tag-name">link</span> rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="LINK"&gt; tag, between
          the &lt;<span class="tag-name">head</span>&gt; tags of your HTML.

        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Multiple CSS can be linked to a single
          HTML document, with the most specific rules applying the style
          to the webpage. That is, there can be multple rules which govern how an
          element should be styled but it is the <b>most specific</b> rule that
          <b>is</b> applied. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">Inheritance</a>
          mechanisms helps determine what styling is applied to elements of
          a HTML document, with descendants of an element, i.e. tags
          nested in other tags, inheriting the style of their ancestor elements.
          The inheritance mechanism relies on the tree-like structure of the DOM
          to determine styling for descendants. The style applied directly to
          a descendant overrides the style inherited from an ancestor, i.e. the
          <b>most specific</b> rule is applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS starts with a selector, which identifies what elements to apply
          the style to. Selectors can be tag names, and will apply to all elements
          of that tag, or can be more specific and target elements of a specific
          class. CSS syntax follows this simple structure:
        </p>
        <pre>
          SELECTOR {
            ATTRIBUTE: VALUE;
          }
        </pre>

          CSS-Tricks (which is a great website and youtube channel), provides a good
          introduction to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/">CSS-Selectors</a>
          which is well worth checking out. There are also LOTS of different
          attributes that can be specified to style HTML elements. Mozilla has
          a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS reference</a>
          page that provides information about lots of these attributes and the
          values that can be applied to them. It is important to note that there
          are often several ways of defining the value of an attribute.

          topic was discussed to highlight the importance of good code writing
          format, which helps you write more efficient code, helps you understand
          the code more effeciently and helps foster good communication with other
          coders.

              <li>
                Clean, consistent and logical indentation is very important!
              </li>
              <li>
                Always use double quotes in HTML around attribute values, this helps when
                integrating your HTML with other coding languages later on.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use lower case names when defining class or id attributes, and the names of the attributes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add comments at the end of a large element, e.g. div, to indicate
                where it ends. This can help you find things better.

                Only have one attribute and value pair on each line.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be consistent with the placement of your {} and spacing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use comments sparingly, use them to note the code that relates to
                specific sections of your webpage. Try to keep them to one or two
                sentences max.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a 'TODO:' starter to make a comment about work you
                need to do in the future.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add comments that descripte how you are doing what you're doing or
                why you are doing what you are doing. Don't describe what you are
                doing because the code does this for you!

        <h3>The Box Model</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The box model which describes the components that every element of
          a webpage consists of. These components include a margin, border,
          padding and content. Each of the components plays a specific role in
          providing style to an elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Content</b> is the image or text that appears on a webpage, it sits
            at the centre of the elements box. The other parts of the box 'protect'
            the content so that other webpage elements don't sit to close or obscure
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Padding</b> clears the area around the content and is effected
            by the background color of the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Border</b> goes around the content and padding of the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Margin</b> clears an area around the boarder and is completely
            transparent.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By default the size of an element is equal to the sum of the box component
          pixels. This can make it hard to know how much space the box will take up
          on the screen especially if you are changing elements often. A simpler
          model, called <span class="css-attribute">box-sizing</span> has been
          developed with this in mind and calculates the element size inlcuding
          both the border and padding. It means you can set the overall box size
          and tweaking the padding and border will not change it. Margin is not
          included in this size. There is a drawback to using <span class="css-attribute">box-sizing</span>.
          It's relatively new and special prefixes must be included for some of
          the older browsers to use it:
        </p>
        <pre>
          * {
            -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
            -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
            -ms-box-sizing: border-box;
            box-sizing: border-box;
          }

        <p>
          The flexbox layout method provides a flexible way for describing the
          layout of a webpage. Styling a container/parent <span class="tag-name">div</span>
          with '<span class="css-attribute">display</span>: <span class="css-value">flex</span>;'
          makes the items/child elements try to align with one another. CSS-Tricks

          The Code, Test and Refine process is a good way to work towards creating

        <ol>
          <li>Boxify the design.</li>
          <li>Look for repeated style and symatic elements, i.e. figure out what tags are required.</li>
          <li>Write the HTML.</li>
          <li>Apply style, from the biggest to smallest elements.</li>
          <li>Fix things. Look at the site in different browsers and repeat

          It is important that you validate your code to check that it will work on
          all of the different browsers available. Online tools help check
          <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML</a>
          and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS</a>.
          These methods provide validation icons that can be added to your website
          to show that it meets appropriate standards.

          I learnt a bit about &lt;<span class="tag-name">pre</span>&gt; and
          &lt;<span class="tag-name">code</span>&gt; tags for displaying
          code chunks within HTML. Content within the &lt;<span class="tag-name">pre</span>&gt;
          tag will keepthe formatting that you apply to it within the tag, whereas
          the &lt;<span class="tag-name">code</span>&gt; tag doesn't preserve the
          formatting. The also differ in that the conent of
          a &lt;<span class="tag-name">pre</span>&gt; element will not wrap,
          whereas, content of code will.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Always submit HTML and CSS to an automated validation check! I
            forgot to do this, and the assignment did not pass specifications because of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use semantic element tags to provide elements with meaning. This
            is cleaning than having lots of divs with different tags.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using universal selectors (*) is not recommended, just use body instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the CSS file organised, by writing style tags first, then id tags, and last classes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use lower case letters in hex colour codes, this makes them easier
            to type.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is possible to stack the styling of elements, and is especially
            useful when they all have the same styling. This reduces unneccessary
            repitition in your code. For instance, to style multiple id elements:
            <pre>
              #id1,
              #id2,
              #id3 {
                ATTRIBUTE: VALUE;
              }
