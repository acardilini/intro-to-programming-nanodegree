      <h2>Stage0: Getting Started with HTML</h2>
      <p>
        This section also acts as Stage 1, <em>1.1 The Basics of the Web and HTML</em>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Understanding the Web</h3>
      <p>
        In it's simplest form the World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of
        hyperlinked HTML documents. There are several components of the web which
        are required for it to function including, you and your hardware and a
        browser, the internet and severs. The browser sends HTTP requests to servers
        via the internet which then send back files in response, these files are
        interpretted and displayed by your browser.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, documentsare are the
        heart of the web and tell browsers what pages should look like. These
        documents are written in a text language that browsers can interpret to
        create webpages, links to other pages, embed media and make it possible to
        create the web as we know it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>The Markup Language</h3>
      <p>
        The markup language is made up of tags which define the proporties of an
        element. The majority of tags contain an opening and closing tag, with the
        content between these taking on the properties defined by the tag. The
        properties of a tag are determined by it's name, for instance, to create
        text that is <b>bold</b>, it is wrapped by tags which specify that the text
        should be bold: e.g. &lt;<span style="color:blue">b</span>&gt;CONTENTS&lt;<span style="color:blue">/b</span>&gt;. Where the tag name = b and defines that
        the contents should be bold. You will notice that the closing tag has a
        forward slash '/' before the tag name, this is to distinguish between
        opening and closing tags. There are lots of different tags, each of which
        defines a different property some of which include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h1 style="display:inline">Header 1</h1> to <h6 style="display:inline">Header 6</h6>  = &lt;<span style="color:blue">hX</span>&gt;
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Emphasis</em> = &lt;<span style="color:blue">em</span>&gt;
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="display:inline">Paragraph</p> = &lt;<span style="color:blue">p</span>&gt;
          </li>
        </ul>

        There are also a small number of tags which don't have a closing tag because
        they don't contain content. An example of this is the &lt;<span style="color:blue">br</span>&gt; tag which specifies when a line break should
        occur.

        When a mistake occurs in code it can be easy to want to blame the computer
        for not doing what you want, however, keep in mind that computers are
        'stupid' in the sense that they will only ever do what they are told. So if
        a big occurs it will be a mistake that you have accidently written (or not
        written) into the code.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Tags can also contain attributes, with the value of the attribute defin or additional properties of the content of the tag. This is best highlighted using
        the tag for creating hypelinks because it always requires a specific attribute.
        The tag is &lt;<span style="color:blue">a</span> href="LINK">&gt;CONTENTS&lt;/<span style="color:blue">a</span>&gt;. As you can see this tag includes an attribute,
        <b>href=</b>, in the opening tag. The href attribute specifies the URL of the
        page that the link will go to, with the contents being set up as a link. There
        is a good explaination this tag at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp">W3Schools</a>.

        Another example of a tag which reqires attributes is the &lt;<span>img</span>&gt;
        tag which makes it possible to include images on a webpage. This tag requires
        two standard attributes <b>src=</b>, which indicates the location of the
        image to be used, and <b>alt=</b>, which specifies text to display if the src
        link is broken. The image tag is another example of a tag without a closing tag
        because it doesn't require content.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Container Tags</h3>
      <p>
        Container tags are simply tags which do nothing but contain the content within
        them, and which can be used to add style to content. Two container tags include,
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;<span style="color:blue">span</span>&gt;, an inline tag; and
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;<span style="color:blue">div</span>&gt; a block tag.
          </li>
        </ul>
        All tags have a predefined position type, which specifies whether they are
        <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. This determines how the content within the
        tag behaves in relationship to the elements around it, e.g. other tags. Inline
        elements will sit next to one another on the same line, whereas, block elements
        will cause a line break and sit below the preceeding element. Inline elements
        include, <em>emphasis</em> and <b>bold</b>, which as you can see sit side by
        side with other elements. While, paragraph and headingX, are block elements
        which sit on their own lines.<br><br>
        It is also important to note that any whitespace with HTML code is turned into
        a single space. This includes multiple spaces and enters which will all be
        turned into a single whitespace when rendered.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>HTML Document Setup</h3>
      <p>
        To create a HTML document it must contain a few vital elements which include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;<span>!DOCTYPE HTML</span>&gt; - defines what kind of html the document is.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;<span>HTML</span>&gt; - Surrounds the entrie document
            </li>
          <li>
            &lt;<span>head</span>&gt; - Contains metadata and other scripts like, CSS and Javascrip
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;<span>title</span>&gt; - The title of the page or the URL
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; - Identifies the
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;<span>body</span>&gt; - Everything you actually see on the webpage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        After submitting this page for review I received some great feedback which
        taught me something new. When trying to show HTML code within a HTML document
        special entity syntax must be used, which can be found under <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">HTML entities</a> on
        W3School. An example of these include:
        <xmp>
          &lt;, for 'less than'
          &lt;, for 'greater than'
        </xmp>

        In order to display the text of these HTML entities as an example, as above,
        in an they must be contained within &lt;xmp&gt;CONTENT&lt;/xmp&gt; tags. There
        is some controversy over the use of the &lt;xmp&gt; tag, but a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16783708/how-to-display-raw-html-code-in-pre-or-something-like-it-but-without-escaping-it/16784925#16784925">stack overflow
        thread</a> discusses the problems and solutions for displaying HTML code within
        a HTML document.

      <h2>Stage 1: 1.2 Creating a Structured Document</h2>
      <p>
        This lesson focuses on developing an understanding of how a HTML document is structured and how web
        browsers interpret that structure. It also goes through the purpose of HTML,
        CSS and DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why start learning programming with front-end web development?</b><br>Understanding
        front end web dev is one of the few areas of programming that is visual, which
        allows new students to immediately see the effects of their programming. This is
        a good feedback mechanism for beginner programmers who are just starting to learn.
        It's also an easy way to share what you are creating, which allows you to show
        off your skills to others easily and get feedback.
      </p>

    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Concepts of Webpage Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Having a conceptual understanding of how the different components of a webpage
        work will help translate visual designs into webpages. HTML provides the
        structure of a page, whereas CSS defines the style of the house, such as
        the colouring and decoration. Browsers build a branching tree-like structure
        of the page, which represents the association between different elements.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Inspecting the Web</h3>
      <p>
        Many web browsers have development tools that allow you to inspect the structure
        and underlying code that defines a webpage. You can use google chromes development tools
        by right clicking anywhere on a webpage and selecting 'inspect'. This shows both
        HTML and CSS style, and can be directly interacted with to see how changes
        effect the webpage.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>A Webpage Trinity (HTML-CSS-DOM)</h3>
      <p>
        HTML and CSS are both language of the web with a specific syntax and sets of rules. The basic word in
        the HTML language is 'tag', which browsers turn into elements that form a tree
        (or DOM). The Document Object Model (DOM) is a standard way of representing and
        interacting with HTML tags, and the tree that is seen in a browsers dev tool is
        actually a DOM. Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM which the browser
        use to create the webpage. The HTML document identifies what CSS
        stylesheet that should be used to style the webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a good understand of both HTML and CSS languages it is possible to
        look at a page and see how it can be broken down into it's different
        elements, or how a page might be built.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Boxes, Boxes Everywhere!</h3>
      <p>
        Every element on a webpage is a box, even circles are boxes! CSS can be used
        to style elements, such as coloured boxes, and make the look like circles, e.g.
        'border-radius'. However, the element is still fundamentally a box, its just
        that it's style has been changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about the elements of a website in terms of boxes makes it simple to
        organise and rearrange webpages. It allows you to think about a webpage in
        terms of a grid, and identify where each element will be placed within that grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are given a mock design, it can helpful to boxify the design by drawing
        boxes around the different elements you have identified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boxes are defined by &lt;div&gt; tags. When creating a new webpage, start by
        setting up all of the boxes/div tags you need. To be able to apply style
        to your divs, e.g. size and location, it is helpful to give each element
        a class attribute which distinguishes it's purpose. CSS can then be used
        to style each of the different divs depending on its class. It's important
        to make each class attribute meaningful to the div that it identifies so
        that you recognise what it is at a later date.

      <h3>Expert Tips</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Jacques Favreau</b> - Front End Developer (Udacity)
        Jacques provided the following tips for thinking about the boxes within
        a webpage:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Everything on the web is boxes, so starts with cutting the design into boxes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't worry about content until you have worked out your boxes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start with big boxes and works into the smaller boxes after you have idnetified the big ones.
          </li>
        </ul>
